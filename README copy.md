# 1D Visual Tokenization and Generation

This repo hosts the code and models for the following projects:

- TA-TiTok & MaskGen: [Democratizing Text-to-Image Masked Generative Models with Compact Text-Aware One-Dimensional Tokens](https://tacju.github.io/projects/maskgen.html)

- RAR: [Randomized Autoregressive Visual Generation](https://yucornetto.github.io/projects/rar.html)

- TiTok: [An Image is Worth 32 Tokens for Reconstruction and Generation](https://yucornetto.github.io/projects/titok.html)

## Updates
- 01/17/2025: We release the training code, inference code and model weights of TA-TiTok.
- 01/14/2025: The [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07730) of TA-TiTok and MaskGen is available. TA-TiTok is an innovative text-aware transformer-based 1-dimensional tokenizer designed to handle both discrete and continuous tokens. MaskGen is a powerful and efficient text-to-image masked generative model trained exclusively on open-data. For more details, refer to the [README_MaskGen](README_MaskGen.md).
- 11/04/2024: We release the [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00776) and code for RAR models.
- 10/16/2024: We update a set of TiTok tokenizer weights trained with an updated single-stage recipe, leading to easier training and better performance. We release the weight of different model size for both VQ and VAE variants TiTok, which we hope could facilitate the research in this area. More details are available in the [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07730) of TA-TiTok. 
- 09/25/2024: TiTok is accepted by NeurIPS 2024.
- 09/11/2024: Release the training codes of generator based on TiTok. 
- 08/28/2024: Release the training codes of TiTok.
- 08/09/2024: Better support on loading pretrained weights from huggingface models, thanks for the help from [@NielsRogge](https://github.com/NielsRogge)！
- 07/03/2024: Evaluation scripts for reproducing the results reported in the paper, checkpoints of TiTok-B64 and TiTok-S128 are available.
- 06/21/2024: Demo code and TiTok-L-32 checkpoints release. 
- 06/11/2024: The [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07550) of TiTok is available.

## Short Intro on [Democratizing Text-to-Image Masked Generative Models with Compact Text-Aware One-Dimensional Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07730) ([README](README_MaskGen.md))

We introduce TA-TiTok, a novel text-aware transformer-based 1D tokenizer designed to handle both discrete and continuous tokens while effectively aligning reconstructions with textual descriptions.
Building on TA-TiTok, we present MaskGen, a versatile text-to-image masked generative model framework. Trained exclusively on open data, MaskGen demonstrates outstanding performance: with 32 continuous tokens, it achieves a FID score of 6.53 on MJHQ-30K, and with 128 discrete tokens, it attains an overall score of 0.57 on GenEval.

## Short Intro on [Randomized Autoregressive Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00776) ([README](README_RAR.md))

RAR is a an autoregressive (AR) image generator with full compatibility to language modeling. It introduces a randomness annealing strategy with permuted objective at no additional cost, which enhances the model's ability to learn bidirectional contexts while leaving the autoregressive framework intact. RAR sets a FID score 1.48, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-256 benchmark and significantly outperforming prior AR image generators.

## Short Intro on [An Image is Worth 32 Tokens for Reconstruction and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07550) ([README](README_TiTok.md))

We present a compact 1D tokenizer which can represent an image with as few as 32 discrete tokens. As a result, it leads to a substantial speed-up on the sampling process (e.g., **410 × faster** than DiT-XL/2) while obtaining a competitive generation quality.
